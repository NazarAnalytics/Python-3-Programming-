Hello and welcome to my variables tutorial video. In this video I will teach
you about variables, which you will quickly find yourself using extremely
frequently. 

Variables act as a placeholder for whatever you place in them, and, can be
changed... so they are... you guessed it... VARIABLE!

exampleVar = 55
print(exampleVar)

#cannotDo = Hey!

canDo = 'Hey!'
print(canDo)

canContainOperations = 5/4
print(canContainOperations) 

#canEvenContainFunctions = # but more on that later....
