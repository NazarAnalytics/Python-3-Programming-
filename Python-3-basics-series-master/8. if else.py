'''

hello everyone and welcome to my if else basics tutorial.

The idea of the if else pairing is to add 1 more layer of logic to the
usage of your if statement here. The else statement can actually be used
in quite a few other ways, like with while, for, and except.

Here, the idea is to ask if something is the case, like we did before...
... and, if it is not the case, then do something else. In this case,

we will just print something basic. 


'''


x = 5
y = 8

if x < y:
    print('x is greater than y')
if x > 55:
    print('x is greater than 55')
else:
    print('x is not greater than y or 55')
