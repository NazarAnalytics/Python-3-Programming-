So now I just briefly want to cover multi line print outs.
I remember making beautiful print outs as sort of guis, but I would do
print and then print out the line, then another print... and so on,
but you can actually do multi line prints with just 1 print. So let's see:

print(
'''
This
is
a
test 
'''
    )

print(
'''
So it works like a multi-line
comment, but it will print out.

You can make kewl designs like this:

|    BOX     |
|            |
